# Creative Coding NFT

> let's creative coding!

## Overview
- A app lets you create dynamic NFTs using a creative coding tool
  - [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/)
  - [textmode.js](https://code.textmode.art/) - _soon_

## Demo

- **URL**: https://cc.0x7.sh
- **Slides**: [google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zl6uGibbwpp-xCftnFN8bj_i1ZvG4GeT3SnJSwTYHEM/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Demo**: _TBA_

## Push Points

1. You can specify an HTML file in the animation_url field of the NFT's metadata. Since this HTML is hosted on IPFS, platforms like OpenSea recognize it as a dynamic NFT (more details are explained in the slides).
2. In addition to viewing previews of other works and forking them, you can also preview by giving instructions to an AI. This means you can enjoy creating even without knowing the tool's functions directly, as it also supports direct code editing.
